Toolkit to translate password dictionaries into German, but possibly to other languages. Includes tools to generate the training dataset by using local ollama or OpenAI API. Fine tune a llama3 model into the translation task using Unsloth. A script to translate a password dictionary using the finetuned model. And finally a translation into German of rockyou.txt as rockdich.txt. Each script has a description comment in the same file.
